//Steps to Implement Singleton Class in C++:

//1. Make all the constructors of the class private.
//2 .Delete the copy constructor of the class.
//3 .Make a private static pointer that can point to the same class object (singleton class).
//4 .Make a public static method that returns the pointer to the same class object (singleton class).

    getInstance() is a static method that returns an
    instance when it is invoked. It returns the same
    instance if it is invoked more than once as an instance
    of Singleton class is already created. It is static
    because we have to invoke this method without any object
    of Singleton class and static method can be invoked
    without object of class
 
    As constructor is private so we cannot create object of
    Singleton class without a static method as they can be
    called without objects. We have to create an instance of
    this Singleton class by using getInstance() method.

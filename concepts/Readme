deep copy:
if the variables of an object have been dynamically allocated, then it is required to do a Deep Copy in order to create a copy of the object.
Shallow copy:
In shallow copy, an object is created by simply copying the data of all variables of the original object
If some variables are dynamically allocated memory from heap section, then the copied object variable will also reference the same memory location.
This will create ambiguity and run-time errors, dangling pointer. 

 C++ compiler implicitly creates a copy constructor and overloads assignment operator in order to perform shallow copy at compile time.

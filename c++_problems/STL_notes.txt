STL:

It is a set of C++ template classes to provide common programming data structures and functions such as lists, stacks, arrays, etc. 
It is a library of container classes, algorithms, and iterators. 
It is a generalized library and so, its components are parameterized

range of containers, such as vectors, lists, and maps, as well as algorithms for searching, sorting and manipulating data

Write an algorithm once, and then use it with different types of data without having to write separate code for each type

STL has 4 components:

Algorithms : such as sort, find, and binary_search, which can be used to manipulate data stored in containers.
Containers : containers, such as vector, list, map, set, and stack, which can be used to store and manipulate data.
Functors : are objects that can be used as function arguments to algorithms , pass a function to an algorithm, allowing you to customize its behavior.
Iterators : provide a way to traverse the elements of a container , such as forward_iterator, bidirectional_iterator, and random_access_iterator, that can be used with different types of containers
Adapters: modify the behavior of other components in the STL. For e.g, the reverse_iterator adapter can be used to reverse the order of elements in a container.

1 . Algorithms
    defines a collection of functions specially designed to be used on a range of elements
    act on containers and provide means for various operations for the contents of the containers

    Algorithm
		Sorting
		Searching
		Important STL Algorithms
		Useful Array algorithms
		Partition Operations
	Numeric
		valarray class
2 . Containers
	Total seven standards “first-class” container classes and three container adaptor classes and only seven header files that provide access to these containers or container adaptors.
	
	Sequence Containers: implement data structures that can be accessed in a sequential manner.
		vector
		list
		deque
		arrays
		forward_list( Introduced in C++11)
		Container Adaptors: provide a different interface for sequential containers.
		queue
		priority_queue
		stack
	Associative Containers: implement sorted data structures that can be quickly searched (O(log n) complexity).
		set
		multiset
		map
		multimap
	Unordered Associative Containers: implement unordered data structures that can be quickly searched
		unordered_set (Introduced in C++11)
		unordered_multiset (Introduced in C++11)
		unordered_map (Introduced in C++11)
		unordered_multimap (Introduced in C++11)
3 . Functors
		classes that overload the function call operator. Instances of such classes are called function objects or functors. 
		Functors allow the working of the associated function to be customized with the help of parameters to be passed
4 . Iterators
		iterators are used for working on a sequence of values. They are the major feature that allows generality in STL

Dequeue : inseration deleetion from both ends
          no contagious memory location
		  mayn fixed static arrays are used
		  This is also dynamic
